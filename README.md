A couple examples of simple 3d particle systems using the terrific [Libgdx](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com) framework.

Taken partly from [this](http://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/3D-Particle-Effects) tutorial.

To run the Java code, you'll need Gradle version 1.10, which you can find [here](https://gradle.org/gradle-download/) and look for 'Previous Releases'. To run the scala code, you'll need Scala and SBT which you can find [here](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/) and [here](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).

Java:
```cd java/
gradle desktop:run
```

Scala:
```cd scala/
sbt desktop/run
```
